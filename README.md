# shell-math
This is a simple terminal mathematical expression solver using C++. The goal of this project is to learn more about creating terminal applications and to practice and apply concepts seen in the Compilers I course at the University. Its current version allows for lexical analysis of the expression, verifying that the symbols in it follow a defined pattern. In future updates, the syntactic analyzer will be implemented.
